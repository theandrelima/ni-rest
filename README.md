**NI-REST** transforms the `network-importer` library into a robust, scalable REST API service. It allows you to run network import and automation jobs via HTTP, track their progress in real-time, and manage all configuration through a clean web interface and environment variables.

The service features a powerful CLI for easy management and automatically adapts its execution strategy, running jobs asynchronously with Celery workers when available, or synchronously for simpler setups.
